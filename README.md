# Widget test

This repository is for testing the creation of Widgets using React to be deployed to Netlify and embedded within external apps using iframes. The code is very messy as this is a proof of concept.

## Content:

There are currently two very simple widgets:

- Counter
- Message

## To run:

```
pnpm dev
```

Each widget has an example html page available at `localhost:5173/examples/<widget_name>`

For example: `localhost:5173/examples/counter`
