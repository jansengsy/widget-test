# Widget test

This repository is for testing the creation of Widgets using React to be deployed to Netlify and embedded within external apps using iframes. This code is a proof of concept and as such is incredibly messy.

## Content:

There are currently two simple widgets:

- Counter
- Message

## To run:

```
pnpm dev
```

Each widget has an example html page available at `localhost:5173/examples/<widget_name>`

For example: `localhost:5173/examples/counter`
